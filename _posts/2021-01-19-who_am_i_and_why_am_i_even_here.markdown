Even as a child I was frequently told that I overanalyze everything. Personally, I think that I simply ask myself and the world around me a lot of questions and then subsequently seek the answers to said questions. This, coupled with an excellent innate memory create an individual quite capable of being an extraordinarily obnoxious know it all who has, through thorough analysis, found that it is frequently better not to make this fact obvious.

I consider myself to be but a fledgling data scientist. Like many others I followed a path to Flatiron School with the intent to better myself and my life. My original thinking was that I was finally going to buckle down, learn how to code and start making the big bucks in the tech industry, though like many a naive soul, I had know idea what that actually meant. I needed a direction. A place to start. 

Through an app called Career Karma I found a number of doors each with different paths towards the same goal. It asked the question, "Which of these options appeals to you more?" Web design, engineering or data science? I almost picked engineering, as I had taken a personality test and scored nearly identically to it as I did with data science. I had no idea at the time what data science and the number next to it intrigued me so I set out to properly define it.

I never did properly define it.

Before I had any true understanding of what it was I was enrolled in Flatirons bootcamp, reading intros about statistics and machine learning algorithms all the while skoffing at seemingly terrifying words like calculus. I quickly realized that I already had a better understanding of code than was expected.

Concerning code and tech in general. I have a bad habit of convincing myself that I have to be an expert to earn a seat at any given table. I had convinced myself that I needed to be capable of writing beautiful, elegantly flowing lines of code while effortlessly integrating esoteric api's in order to step up to the plate. I vastly underestimated the value of simply understanding syntax and even knowing what an api was to begin with. This neurotic need for mastery is both my biggest downfall and greatest asset. It has the capacity to keep me from taking the first step, but it also drives me to forever seek greater understanding.

With all this, I state to you. Here I am. I am no master of the art nor savant. But I humbly request that you allow me a seat at this table which I intend to earn.
